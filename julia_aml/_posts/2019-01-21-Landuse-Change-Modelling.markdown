Using the GIS modelling progam ArcGIS and the ArcMap tool with R, this component introduced the concepts of optimal land-use, within the theme of governence and societal requirements and considering future climates (amongst other paratmeters).

The bulk of the analysis was performed using the DynaClue model, which combines spatially explicit simulations of land-use change at a regional level based on suitability analysis, considering competition and interaction of possible elements on a space and time basis.  Practice in implementing and exploring the intrepretation of outputs was particularly satisfying given the visual nature of the discipline.

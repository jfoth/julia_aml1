The first week of AML introduced the topic of Programming in MatLab, a condensed crash-course in programming in the language of Matlab.

The course moves through the functions of commands and basic language, before moving into utilisation and application over the remainder of the course.

Working arrays, creating plots, graphic models and statistical applications are explored, and *flows*: for and while loops are introduced where the iterative and conditional power of data analysis with machine learning is seen.

>Move to week 2 of the course: [Statistics in R](http://localhost:4000/julia_aml/update/2019/01/14/Basic-Stats.html)

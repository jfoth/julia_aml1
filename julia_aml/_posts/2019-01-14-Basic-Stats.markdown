This Course took the student through the concepts of basic statistics, including the reasoning behind methods used. The result was a working understanding of the base methods of statistical analysis and interpretation of the outputs of any treatments in the R progamming language.

The course work followed the learning in Open Statistics, Third Edition [(PDF available for download)] (https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics) and covered probability, inferencs, multiple regression and touched on linear regression.

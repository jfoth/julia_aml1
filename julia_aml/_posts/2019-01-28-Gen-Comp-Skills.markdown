The topic takes the approach of learn through practice.  The topic begins with data storage; from rock carvings to databases, looking at appropriate application for each method as complexity requirements of the data increases. Data analysis is applied using the SQLite package and the preparation of data [(cleaning)](https://github.com/jfoth/AML/blob/master/JFotheringham_Comp_Skills_Day4/JFotheringham_CompSkills_Day4_sql.md) prior to this is also explored, while guidence to best practice data collation is addressed throughout the course. This website is the culmination of the course, learning to use Jekyll to support my HTML webpage produced some challenges and random errors, which have been negated (possibly at the expense of a hardrive filled with missplaced Gem files...).
This excersice allows practice with Terminal command line control, markdown, Stackedit, SQLite and Github repositories.
